A Münchhausen number (sometimes spelled Münchausen number, with a single 'h') is a number equal to the sum of its digits raised to each digit's power. Münchhausen numbers therefore differ from narcissistic numbers, which are numbers that equal the sum of a fixed power (in particular, the number of decimal digits) of the given number. The name "Münchhausen number" derives from the fact that these numbers "raise themselves" analogously to way in which Baron Hieronymus von Münchhausen allegedly raised himself by riding a cannonball, as portrayed in the 1943 fantasy comedy film Münchhausen.

If 0s are disallowed (since 0^0 is not well-defined), the only Münchhausen numbers are
